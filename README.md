- Pin important notes
- Bulk operations
- Responsive design

##  Professional Highlights

###  **Enterprise Security Implementation**
- **Zero-Password Authentication**: Email OTP + Google OAuth integration
- **Per-User Rate Limiting**: Individual quotas (200 req/10min) preventing system abuse
- **Attack Prevention**: XSS sanitization, NoSQL injection protection, CSRF protection
- **Security Headers**: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options via Helmet.js middleware

### üöÄ **Production DevOps Pipeline**
- **Containerized Deployment**: Docker multi-stage builds with Node.js 22 LTS
- **CI/CD Automation**: GitHub Actions with automated testing and AWS deployment
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Automated EC2 setup with production environment management
- **Zero-Downtime Deployment**: Health checks, rollback capabilities, backup management

### ‚ö° **Performance & Scalability**
- **Database Optimization**: MongoDB text indexing for sub-second search results
- **Advanced Query System**: Pagination, filtering, sorting with efficient compound indexes
- **Resource Management**: Request size limits, connection pooling, memory optimization
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Structured Winston logging with error tracking and analytics

### üéØ **Modern Development Practices**
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation across frontend and backend
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with consistent error handling and validation
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, and comprehensive error boundary handling
- **Testing Ready**: Structured for unit, integration, and E2E testing implementation

## üìù Demo Notes

### Rate Limiting (Security Feature)
- **Authentication**: 50 requests per 15 minutes per IP (demo-optimized)
- **OTP Cooldown**: 10 seconds between requests (balances security and UX)
- **Note**: In production, these limits can be adjusted based on usage patterns

### Mobile Access
Due to modern mobile browser security policies blocking HTTP connections, 
mobile access may be limited. This is intentional for the demo environment.
Production deployment would use HTTPS with SSL certificates.
- **Zero-Downtime Deployment**: Health checks, rollback capabilities, backup management

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React 19 with TypeScript
- Vite for development
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### Backend
- Node.js with Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- JWT authentication
- TypeScript

### Infrastructure
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Multi-stage builds
- Volume persistence
- GitHub Actions CI/CD
- AWS EC2 deployment

## Quick Start with Docker

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed and running
- Docker Compose v2+ (newer `docker compose` syntax)

### Setup
```bash
# Clone and start
git clone <repository-url>
cd highway-delite
docker compose up -d

# Access the application
# Frontend: http://localhost:5173
# Backend: http://localhost:5000
```

### Docker Commands
```bash
# Start all services
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f [service-name]

# Stop all services
docker compose down

# Fresh start (removes all data)
docker compose down -v && docker compose up -d
```

### Docker Compose Version Note
This project uses the newer `docker compose` syntax (Docker Compose v2+). The old `docker-compose` syntax is deprecated on modern platforms including GitHub Actions, AWS, and newer Docker installations.
